In this repo I suggeting free course from coursera for hands on tensorrt:

https://www.coursera.org/projects/tensorflow-tensorrt

it takes about 2 houre to complit the course, also I provided completed colab notebook for this course in:

[colab notebook](Optimize_TensorFlow_Models_For_Deployment_with_TensorRT.ipynb)




for more information about tensorrt you can see:

maybe it encourage you (!) that after passing course seccessfully you will get certification like this:
