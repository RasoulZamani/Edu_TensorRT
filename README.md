# Hands on TensorRT

TensorRT is a machine learning framework that is published by Nvidia to run inference that is machine learning inference on their hardware. TensorRT is highly optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs.


In this repo I segesting free course from coursera for hands on tensorrt:

it takes about 2 houre to complit the course, also I provided completed colab notebook for this cours in:
